# homebase-react

> The local-first immutable datalog database for React by [homebase](https://homebase.dev).

This repository contains the packages for both ClojureScript (CLJS) and Javascript (JS). [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) is the primary target for CLJS, although homebase-react also aims to support [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum), [Sablano](https://github.com/r0man/sablono), [UIX](https://github.com/roman01la/uix) and [Helix](https://github.com/lilactown/helix) as well. [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is the only target for JS.
