*The React state management library for write-heavy applications*

Supported languages, frameworks and DBs:

- JS + React + Datascript ([jump](#javascript--react))
- CLJS + Reagent + Datascript ([jump](#clojurescript--reagent))
- *Datahike support coming soon*

## What and Why

As data and our need to annotate and organize it grows, so does our need for supporting state in *write-heavy* applications.

To solve this problem, modern write-heavy applications such as Superhuman, Roam Research, and Facebook Messenger built their own embedded data layers to enable these more sophisticated user experiences. 

Homebase-react enables developers to access the same embedded datalog database as Roam Research through React hooks. You no longer have to build out a team or learn specialized tools like Clojure in order to build a delightful write-heavy application.


## Testimonials
> Homebase is executing on the vision of data usage, portability, and management we had when building Firebase. We never got there. I'm excited!

> ‚ÄîJames Tamplin, Founder/CEO of Firebase

> Datalog is the future of end-user programming, personal productivity software, p2p software, etc.

# Javascript + React

Start by installing `homebase-react`.

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/homebase-react)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebase-react)
[![Bundle Size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/homebase-react)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebase-react)

```bash
# NPM
npm install homebase-react --save

# Yarn
yarn add homebase-react
```

Optionally install the `datalog-console` [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/datalog-console/cfgbajnnabfanfdkhpdhndegpmepnlmb?hl=en) to inspect the `homebase-react` DB in your browser.

‚≠êÔ∏è üìñ **[Read the JS docs](https://homebase.io/docs/homebase-react)** ‚öõÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è

```js
import { useCallback } from 'react'
import { HomebaseProvider, useEntity, useTransact } from 'homebase-react'

const RootComponent = () => (
  // Create a DB and set some starting data
  <HomebaseProvider config={{ initialData: [{ counter: { id: 1, count: 0 }}] }}>
    <App/>
  </HomebaseProvider>
)

const App = () => {
  // Get entity id = 1
  const [counter] = useEntity(1)
  const [transact] = useTransact()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => {
      // Increment and save the count
      transact([{ counter: { 
        id: 1, count: counter.get('count') + 1 
      }}])
    }>
      {/* Render the count */}
      Increment {counter.get('count')}
    </button>
  )
}
```

# ClojureScript + Reagent

Start by adding `homebase-react`.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/io.homebase/homebase-react.svg)](https://clojars.org/io.homebase/homebase-react)

Optionally add `datalog-console` and its corresponding [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/datalog-console/cfgbajnnabfanfdkhpdhndegpmepnlmb?hl=en) to inspect the DB in your browser.

```clojure
(ns dev.example.reagent.counter
  (:require
   [datascript.core :as d]
   [homebase.reagent :as hbr]
   [datalog-console.integrations.datascript :as datalog-console]))

(def db-conn (d/create-conn {}))
(d/transact! db-conn [[:db/add 1 :count 0]]) ; Transact some starting data.
(hbr/connect! db-conn) ; Connect homebase.reagent to the database.
(datalog-console/enable! {:conn db-conn}) ; Also connect the datalog-console extension for better debugging.

(defn counter []
  (let [[entity] (hbr/entity db-conn 1)] ; Get a homebase.reagent/Entity. Note the use of db-conn and not @db-conn, this makes it reactive.
    (fn []
      [:div
       "Count: " (:count @entity) ; Deref the entity just like a reagent/atom.
       [:div
        [:button {:on-click #(d/transact! db-conn [[:db/add 1 :count (inc (:count @entity))]])} ; Use d/transact! just like normal.
         "Increment"]]])))
```

## Roadmap

1. ~~Improve developer tools: custom chrome formatters, DB admin console extension~~
2. ~~Rewrite React ‚Üî Homebase cache~~
    1. ~~Support async DB access (for Datahike)~~
    2. ~~Reactive query planning (better perf on pages with lots of live reads)~~
3. Swap [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) out for [Datahike](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike)
    1. Immutability
    2. History / Change Tracking
4. Persist to IndexedDB
5. [Local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html) conflict resolution for offline caching and sync between multiple devices

## Limitations

Homebase React is currently not a good choice for read-heavy applications (e.g. Twitter, ecommerce). We plan to support these query patterns with our [platform](http://homebase.io) eventually.

## Alternatives

There isn't much in the way of React friendly datalog DB based state management for Javascript, but there's at least one alternative if you're a Clojure dev.

- If your prefer `d/pull` over `d/entity` take a look at [Posh](https://github.com/denistakeda/posh). It supports less of the `d/q` API, but provides more tools for tuning performance.

## Development

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Test

```bash
yarn install
yarn test
```
