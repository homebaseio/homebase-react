## What and Why

As data and our need to annotate and organize it grows, so does our need for supporting state in *write-heavy* applications.

To solve this problem, modern write-heavy applications such as Superhuman, Roam Research, and Facebook Messenger built their own embedded data layers to enable these more sophisticated user experiences. 

Homebase-react enables developers to access the same embedded datalog database as Roam Research through React hooks. You no longer have to build out a team or learn specialized tools like Clojure in order to build a delightful write-heavy application.

## Install

```bash
# NPM
npm install homebase-react --save

# Yarn
yarn add homebase-react
```
