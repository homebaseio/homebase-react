# Roam example

An example of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) built with Homebase React.

Roam and Homebase use the same underlying [graph database](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), making Roam a great demonstration of what can be accomplished with ease with a graph DB at the heart of your application.
